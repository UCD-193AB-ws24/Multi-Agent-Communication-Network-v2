# Test-Flow
# A network-measuring Python test program (not our Python server, but a lot of the same code).
# 1 -  Python test program send command to Edge-device (ras-pi) to change the test mode
# 2 - Ras-pi return confirm
# 3 - Python Bcast a pkt to start the current test and measures the metric
# 4 - Python Bcast a pkt to finish the current test
# 5 - Record Measurement

# For example: (connect 10 node speed)
# 1 - Python sends ‘Test-0’ to all edge device
# 2 - Ras-pi all confirm copy on changing test mode
# 3 - Python start timer and Broadcast ‘START’ to all ras-pi & reset ESP-root
# 4 - Ras-pi restart the ESP-edge
# 5 - Python stop timer when all 10 nodes are connected
# 6 - Python Broadcast ‘FINISH’ to stop the current test
# 7 - Record the Timestamp of each node connected
